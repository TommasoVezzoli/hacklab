1: The internet speed with your fiber optic service has been consistently poor, especially when I try to use Streaming TV. This is unacceptable for the high monthly charges I'm paying. 2: When I contacted customer support about the slow internet, I was told there was no issue on your end, but the problem still hasn't been resolved. This lack of assistance is incredibly frustrating.
